#! example is based on the following post: https://bit.ly/2QNCWab
#! let's make it possible to have multiple copies
#! of the app: apple, banana, orange. to do so pull
#! reusable functionality into a set of functions.
#! take a look and move to next example: k8s-ingress-with-objs

#@ def/end app_labels(app):
app: #@ app.name

#@ def app_svc_name(app):
#@   return app.name + "-svc"
#@ end

#@ def app_config(app):
---
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: #@ app.name + "-app"
  labels: #@ app_labels(app)
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: hashicorp/http-echo
    args:
    - -listen=:(@= str(app.port) @)
    - -text=(@= app.text @)
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: #@ app_svc_name(app)
spec:
  selector: #@ app_labels(app)
  ports:
  - port: #@ app.port
#@ end
