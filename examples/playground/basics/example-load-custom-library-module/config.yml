#! it can be useful to organize separate components into
#! libraries. libraries are folders within the _ytt_lib
#! directory and their modules can be loaded as shown below

#! anything inside the library's own _ytt_lib folder
#! is not accessible to library consumers, allowing the
#! library to have private functionality

#@ load("@github.com/k14s/test-lib:funcs.star", "testfunc")

result: #@ testfunc()
